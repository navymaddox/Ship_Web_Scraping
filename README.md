# Ship_Web_Scraping
The following script was designed to scrape images of Naval Warships from Google Images. These images are then saved to the file path of choice, in my case it was my Google Drive. The images are then split into training, testing, and validation data sets. This script also provides augmentation for the training images, which are saved as JPEG for offline analysis.
